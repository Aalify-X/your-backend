' Q: Why is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multi-cellular organisms like humans?\nA: Diffusion is insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multi-cellular organisms like humans because not all cells in a larger organism may be in direct contact with the surrounding environment, making it difficult for oxygen and nutrients to reach all cells through simple diffusion.\n\nQ: What criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive?\nA: We tend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as common evidence for being alive. However, using visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough, as movements over very small scales, such as molecular movements, are necessary for life.\n\nQ: What are outside raw materials used for by an organism?\nA: Outside raw materials are used by organisms for growth, development, synthesizing protein and other substances needed in the body, as well as for energy generation.\n\nQ: What processes would you consider essential for maintaining life?\nA: Essential processes for maintaining life include obtaining energy and materials from outside sources, breaking them down or building them up in the body, converting them to a uniform source of energy and molecules, and transporting them within the organism for various molecular movements and growth.\n\nQ: What is Autotrophic Nutrition, and how do autotrophic organisms fulfill their carbon and energy requirements?\nA: Autotrophic Nutrition is the process by which autotrophs, such as green plants and some bacteria, take in substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of energy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water, which is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilized for providing energy to the plant. The carbohydrates which are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which serves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required by the plant.\n\nQ: What is Heterotrophic Nutrition, and how do heterotrophic organisms fulfill their energy and material requirements?\nA: Heterotrophic organisms, such as animals and fungi, utilize complex substances for their energy and material requirements. These complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones before they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To achieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Heterotrophic organisms depend directly or indirectly on autotrophs for their survival.'
